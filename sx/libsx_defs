# All configuration options are at the top.  The things you'll want to
# look at are the CC variable, CFLAGS variable and the RANLIB
# variable.
#
# On Suns and DECstations we use gcc because the code is ANSI and
# their base compilers don't deal with ANSI code.
#
# On an SGI you can use plain old cc (or gcc if you feel like it and
# you have it).  Using cc seems to also work on the RS/6000 (though
# you may need the -xansi or -ansi flag). 
CC     = gcc
#CC     = cc


# Using gcc it's nice to be real strict and compile with -Wall, for
# production versions of the library you probably just want -O or -O2
#
# The -D_POSIX_SOURCE define is necessary on some systems (sun) 
# and less necessary on some systems like SGI.
#
# The -DOPENGL_SUPPORT is still preliminary and not suggested for
# general use (though if you do use it, I'd like to hear about it).
#
#
# On an SGI running Irix 5.x, I use:
#  CFLAGS = -O2 -D_POSIX_SOURCE
#
# On a sun w/sunos 4.1.1, I use:
#  CFLAGS = -O2 -D_POSIX_SOURCE
#
# On a DECstation, I used:
#  CFLAGS = -O2 -I/usr/include/mit
#  
# If you're daring, and you have OpenGL, try:
#  CFLAGS = -g -D_POSIX_SOURCE -DOPENGL_SUPPORT
#
CFLAGS = -g -fpic -D_POSIX_SOURCE -DXAW3D -I/local/X11R6/include
CPPFLAGS = -I..

#
# if you are on a System V (like the SGI) machine, just define RANLIB
# to be something innocuous like `echo'. On a Sun or other BSD machine
# (like a DECstation) we need to run the ranlib program.
#
RANLIB=ranlib
#RANLIB=echo

#
# libraries we need to link with...
#
# For most machines, the standard link line is fine.  For some you'll
# need to add -lXext, and if you compiled with -DOPENGL_SUPPORT, then
# you'll need to add -lGL for _any_ program that links with libsx.
#
# For SGI and sun, the following is fine:
#   LIBS   =  $(LIBSX) -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#
# For a DECstation, use:
#   LIBS   =  $(LIBSX) -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lXext
#
# Some other machines may need to append a -lm to the line.
#
# Again, if you're daring and have OpenGL, use:
#   LIBS   =  $(LIBSX) -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lXext -lGL
#
LIBSX  = ./libsx.a
#LIBS   =  $(LIBSX) -lXaw3d -lXmu -lXt -lX11
LIBS   =  $(LIBSX) -L/usr/X11R6/lib/elf -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11
